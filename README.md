# L.U.N.A. - Laser-Mapping Unidirectional Navigation Actuator
## Introduction
The L.U.N.A. sphere has a simple goal: roll into an area and create a 3D model of the environment. The design was chosen due to its multi-directional nature, however the current prototype was build to roll in one direction only.

Different application scenarios could include:
* Mapping of underground tunnels that are not accessible to humans or larger robots
* Mapping of planetary surfaces (such as lunar craters) and similar scenarios.

The project was developed within the _FloatSat_ - Module of the Julius-Maximilians-University of WÃ¼rzburg by three Satellite Technology students: Fabian A., Anton B. and Jasper Z.
